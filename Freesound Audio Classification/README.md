# Freesound Audio Classification

The aim of this project is to classify audio files which are taken from real life senarios for example music instruments, machines, animals, humans etc. 
Out of these few are labelled but not all. Which is what is challenging 

Data is taken from the [Freesound general purpose Audio tagging challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/freesound-audio-tagging).
