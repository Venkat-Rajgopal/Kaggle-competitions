# Data Science Bowl.

This project is [Kaggles's data science bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018) competition launced in 2018. 



Nuclei are distinctive in every image and spotting each of them manually with human eye is tedious and time consuming. Not to mention the fact that manual spotting can also lead to errors. Idea is to detect nclei as below.

Though the task here is to identify a range of nuclei across varied conditions, this notebook is an introductory approach for detecting nuclei in a nuclus. We analyse the data (using opencv and scipy-image).
